# Updox Java Coding Challenge README
Blake Williams

Welcome to my Java coding submission. I am very excited to demonstrate my object oriented programming skills for the Updox team, so let's get started!

# Run
Ensure Java v1.8 or later is installed. This project was built using Maven.

From the project root, run the following command to execute the included jar.

> java -jar target/UpdoxCodingChallengeJava-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Testing
All tests were written using JUnit 5 and are found in the src/main/test directory.
+ Code Coverage: 99.0% (100% code coverage outside of the System.in stream catch blocks for IOExceptions) 
+ JUnit Tests: 14/14 passing

A test driven development approach was followed to generate a range of initial test cases and build out the prime number generator.

# Updox Java Coding Challenge README
Blake Williams

Welcome to my coding submission. I am very excited to demonstrate my object oriented programming skills for the Updox team, so let's get started!

# Run
Ensure Java v1.8 or later is installed.

From the project root, run the following command to execute the included jar.

> java -jar dist/UpdoxCodingChallenge.jar

# Build
Ensure Ant v1.10 or later is installed. The current project was built using Ant and placed in the dist/ directory, but can be rebuilt by having Ant installed and running the following from the project root:

> ant run

This will place an executable jar in the dist/ directory. If using Eclipse, simply perform a default project clean and build the classes natively.
